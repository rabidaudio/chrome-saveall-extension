chrome-saveall-extension
========================

Save all open tabs to a timestamped directory.

The code is very much hacked together and surely still has some bugs. Released to
Public Domain. 


Usage
-----

Just click the download button, and all tabs in the current window will get saved
to a directory in your Downloads folder. This is basically to save you the effort
of repeatedly alternating Ctrl-S, Enter, Ctrl-PgDn. After all downloads have
started, the directory will open in your file browser and the browser will offer
to close the window.

Downloads are started in parallel all at once, so there may be a little slowdown
on your machine depending on the amount of RAM available to Chrome.

I wish I could make the permissions sound less threatening. You can peak at the code
(it's seriously like 50 lines) and tell it isn't doing anything malicious.
